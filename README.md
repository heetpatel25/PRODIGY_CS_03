# 🔐 Password Complexity Checker  
**Prodigy InfoTech – Cyber Security Internship (Task 03)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Password Complexity Checker** using Python.  
The tool evaluates the **strength and security of user passwords** based on predefined complexity rules and provides feedback to help users create **stronger and more secure passwords**.

This task focuses on **authentication security**, a critical component in cybersecurity systems.

## 🛡️ Features
- Checks password length requirements  
- Validates presence of **uppercase and lowercase letters**  
- Ensures inclusion of **numeric characters**  
- Verifies use of **special characters**  
- Provides clear feedback on password strength  
- Helps prevent weak and easily guessable passwords  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User inputs a password  
2. Password is analyzed using defined security rules  
3. The checker verifies:
   - Minimum length  
   - Uppercase and lowercase characters  
   - Digits (0–9)  
   - Special symbols  
4. Password strength is evaluated  
5. Feedback is displayed indicating whether the password is **Weak, Moderate, or Strong**
